> You are required to wear either: (i) `one disposable mask underneath a cloth mask` with the edges of the inner mask pushed against your face; or (ii) a properly-fitted, FDA-authorized KN95 (or N95) mask. Gaiters, bandannas, or masks with valves/vents are not acceptable face coverings.  If you do not have the approved mask(s), a screener will provide one. No one will be admitted without the proper `mask(s)`.
