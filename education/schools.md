CDC says risk of coronavirus in schools is small**

> [New research published Tuesday](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775875) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests `the risk of COVID-19 spread in classrooms is relatively low`, `adding new questions over the continued closure of in-person education across the nation.`

> One case-controlled study was in Mississippi. Out of 397 participants, 154 were diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection. Attending close social gatherings or interacting with members outside of their households was a leading cause of infection, but `in-person school attendance was not`. 

> Similar results were recorded when examining 11 school districts in North Carolina, featuring 90,000 students and staff occupying school classrooms for nine weeks. Researchers found that `within-school transmissions were rare`, with only 32 COVID-19 infections traced back to exposure in school settings. A far greater number of infections, 773, were linked to other community sources of transmission.

> “The investigators concluded that these data, together with the observation that rates of infection among teachers and nonteachers were generally similar, indicated that `schools were not associated with accelerating community transmission`,” researchers wrote.
>
> However, other reports outside of the U.S. acknowledge outbreaks that occurred in school settings. Contributing factors were `crowded classrooms, non-universal face mask usage and recirculated air in closed environments`.
